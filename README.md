# Exploratory_Analysis_Of_NASA_Astronauts

## Problem Statement
Astronauts are people trained to pilot a spacecraft,travel in spacecraft or work in space.
There is no doubt that being an astronauts comes with lots of advantadges. One of the main avantadges of being 
an astronaut is the fact that you get to fly in space and see the stars. Also, they are one of the highest paid profesionals in the world however 
it comes with some disadvantadges.Being in spaceship for too long can harm your bones and blood of astronauts, and can affect thier mental health.In addition, they are
susceptible to increased level of dangerous radiation. Would you like to be an astronaut? What does it take to be one?

## Objectives
This project explores Astronauts data sourced from Kaggle (NASA astronauts, 1959-2020) and make insights to encourage people whose dream job  is to be an Astronaut.

## Questions
Some questions I want to find out is 
1) The life expectancy of an astronaut? The life expectancy of female and male astronauts?
2) Do we have almost equal number of female and male astronauts?
3) What educational background does most astronaut have? What is the level of education of most astronaut?
4) The top 5 Undergraduate Universities astronauts attended?
5) The top Countries/States austronauts come from?
6) What is the average number of space flight and space walk of astronauts?
7) What is the average hours of space flight and space walk of astronauts?

## Conclusions and Recommendations
The data had 357 Astronauts with 307 males and 50 females. Out of 357,  51 of them were deceased,220 retired, 50 active and  36 in management. The average life expectancy of an Astronaut is 66 years; that of female is 58  years and male 67 years. Since we have only 50 females, the results  will predominantly favor the men. With respect to the data, the educational background that most Astronuats had both in undegraduate and graduate were Physics, Chemistry, Mathematics, Engeneering Science, Medicine, Aerospace Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Aeronautical Engineering and Electrical Engineering. 298 Astronauts out of 357 had masters degree, which shows that very few of them did not have masters degrees. In addition, the top 5 Undegraduate universities that astronauts attended were US Naval Academy, US Air Force Academy, US Military Academy, Purdue University and MIT.

Its interesring to note that though Astronauts were from all parts of the world, most of them where born in the United States and  mainly from  New York, Texas,California,Ohio and Pennsylvania. The average number of Space Flights  and Space walks is aproximately 2 and 1 respectively while the average hours of Space Flights and average hours of space walks were 1249 hours and 8 hours respectively.

And so, if you are aspiring to be an astronauts, you must have at least a masters degree in a STEM related field in either US Naval Academy, US Air Force Academy
US Military Academy, Purdue University or MIT. Also you must be  U.S. Citizen. These increases your chance of being accepted by NASA. Though we have very few Women we however encourage women to pursue thier dreams as Astronuat.
