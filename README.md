There is no doubt that being an astronauts comes with lots of advantadges. One of the main avantadges of being 
an astronaut is the fact that you get to fly in space and see the stars. Also, they are one of the highest paid profesionals in the world however 
it comes with some disadvantadges.Being in spaceship for too long can harm your bones and blood of astronauts, and can affect thier mental health.In addition, they are
susceptible to increased level of dangerous radiation. Would you like to be an astronaut? What does it take to be one?

This project explores Astronauts data sourced from Kaggle (NASA astronauts, 1959-2020) and make insights to encourage people whose dream job  is to be an Astronaut.

Some questions I want to find out is 
1) The life expectancy of an astronaut? The life expectancy of female and male astronauts?
2) Do we have almost equal number of female and male astronauts?
3) What educational background does most astronaut have? What is the level of education of most astronaut?
4) The top 5 Undergraduate Universities astronauts attended?
5) The top Countries/States austronauts come from?
6) What is the average number of space flight and space walk of astronauts?
7) What is the average hours of space flight and space walk of astronauts?
